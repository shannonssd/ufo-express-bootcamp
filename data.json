I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Banana","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"text":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.
